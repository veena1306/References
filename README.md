# References

# benefits using references :-
   -> Modify arguments inside of the function scope.
   -> Avoids copying objects inside of the function scope.
   
   
 # Pointer Vs References :- 
      1. Pointers do not have to be initialized immedaitely, references gets the value upon creation.
      2. It is possible to chnage the value of pointers, it is impossible to change the variable that the reference references to.
      3. References are safer to use than pointers, since they are guaranteed to contain a valid value, while pointers can point to garbage or null values.
      4. References operate on objects, so no dereferencing is needed.
                                           
# lvalue vs Rvalue References :- 
     1. lvalues are variables with memory.
     2  rvalues are variables without memory.
